# Cellular Automata
A cellular automaton is a discrete model studied in computability theory, mathematics, physics, complexity science, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. Cellular automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays

### MPJ
[Mattias Petter Johansson aka MPJ](https://github.com/mpj) over at [funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) on YouTube did a [pairs programming video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk) with [Irina Shestak](https://github.com/lrlna). They built a [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) thing so I made it too.

### The Code
It's pretty bad, not gonna lie. I'll turn this into something though since there isn't a whole lot to it.
